# Blood Sync: Real-Time Blood Donation Coordination Platform

Blood Sync is a comprehensive web application designed to bridge the gap between blood donation camps and hospitals in need. It provides a real-time, map-based platform for NSS (National Service Scheme) coordinators to manage donation camps with detailed donor tracking, and for hospitals to request blood supplies efficiently based on proximity and availability.

- **Camp History**: View comprehensive summaries of past camps including total donations, donor counts, and blood type breakdowns.
- **Targeted Requests**: Hospitals can send blood requests directly to a specific camp based on proximity and available inventory.
- **Geolocation**: Camps are created using the coordinator's live GPS coordinates, ensuring accurate location data.
- **Instant Communication**: The platform is built on Firebase, allowing for real-time updates for requests, inventory changes, and donor records.

## 🚀 User Roles & Functionality

### 🏥 Hospital Dashboard

- **View Camps on Map**: See all active donation camps marked on a `react-leaflet` map. Your hospital's location is also marked for easy reference.
- **Camp Details**: Click on a camp to view its exact location, the name of the coordinator, and its current blood inventory.
- **Calculate Distance**: Automatically calculates and displays the distance from the hospital to each camp using the Haversine formula.
- **Send Blood Requests**: Select a camp and fill out a form to request a specific blood type and number of units. The system validates that the requested units don't exceed available inventory.
- **Track Requests**: Monitor the status of sent requests (Pending, Delivering, Delivered).
- **Delete Requests**: Remove your own requests if needed.

### 🏕️ NSS Coordinator Dashboard

#### Active Camp Management:
- **Start Camps**: Create a new donation camp session at your current location. The system automatically captures GPS coordinates and initializes inventory for all 8 standard blood types.
- **End Camps**: Close camp sessions. Camps are archived as "inactive" rather than deleted, preserving historical data.
- **Donor Registration**: Add new donors with automatically generated UUIDs, capturing:
  - Contact information (phone/email)
  - Blood type
  - Units donated
  - Timestamp
- **View Donors by Blood Type**: Click on any blood type to see all donors who contributed that type, with donor count badges.
- **Edit Donor Information**: Update donor contact details, blood type, or units. Inventory is automatically adjusted.
- **Delete Donor Records**: Remove donor entries with automatic inventory adjustment and confirmation prompts.
- **Real-Time Inventory**: Blood inventory updates automatically as donors are added, edited, or removed.
- **Manage Requests**: View incoming blood requests from hospitals and update their status (Pending → Delivering → Delivered).

#### Past Camps History:
- **Camp Summaries**: View all previously ended camps with:
  - Total units donated across all blood types
  - Total number of donors
  - Detailed blood type breakdown
  - Camp duration (start and end dates)
  - Location and coordinator information
- **Historical Analytics**: Track your donation camp performance over time.
